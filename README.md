# Estuary Vision Pro Client
### Description
This Unity project demonstrates an Apple Vision Pro client connected to a Mangrove server.  The Vision Pro was chosen for this demo for its state of the art hardware capabilities and powerful ARKit integration.  Namely, this demo showcases realtime dynamic mesh generation and semantic scene understanding of a physical environment which are both leveraged to power a conversational Intelligent Virtual Agent (IVA) that can understand and pathfind in a physical environment in Augmented Reality (AR).
