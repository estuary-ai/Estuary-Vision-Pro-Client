This folder (ObjectTracking) contains a folder called `Template`.  Inside you will find a CubeTemplatePNG.png file.  You may print this image to create the 3D object that is referenced in the UnityCube.referenceobject.  This model is used in the reference object library in this sample. The CubeTemplatePNG image is meant to be cut out, folded, and glued together to create a paper cube.

If you don't want to print it out and fold it, you can extract a USDZ file out of UnityCube.referenceobject to display on your screen.  Bring up the file in finder, rename it to include the extension .zip and then extract it.  You should see a file called `object.usdz` inside.  You can display the object.usdz on screen with macOS QuickLook (select the file and press the space bar) to test object tracking. Note that you will need to resize and rotate the cube a little bit to convince the device that it's a real physical object.  It should be roughly 5cm cubed in scale.
